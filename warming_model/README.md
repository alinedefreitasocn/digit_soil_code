# Warming Soil Model
by Aline Lemos de Freitas

The model starts by importing the module `warming_model`
```import warming_model```
it will start the variables with the initial parameters that can be called as 
```warming_model.params_enzyme_spinup```

From `warming_model` we can initiate the `soil_model` as
```from warming_model import soil_model```
