WARMING SOIL MODEL
===================
by Aline Lemos de Freitas


Based on Allison et al, 2010 create a warming soil model

Create dt as range from 0 to 30 years (in hours)

The model starts by setting the soil organic carbon (SOC),
dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass, and enzyme pools
to their initial values. Microbial biomass changes
by the amount of DOC assimilated, times the carbon use
(or microbial growth) efficiency, minus
biomass death and enzyme production
